### Hi there 👋

Hi! I'm a recent Cornell Computer and Information Science grad working on developing software. At Cornell, I was fortunate enough to conduct research on 3D graph exploration in mixed reality at the [Englander Intitute for Precision Medicine](https://eipm.weill.cornell.edu/) under [Professors Alexandros Sigaras](https://eipm.weill.cornell.edu/team/alex-sigaras/) and [Olivier Elemento](https://eipm.weill.cornell.edu/team/olivier-elemento-3/). My interests, therefore, emerge with a curiousity about how we use technology to make better decisions in healthcare.
